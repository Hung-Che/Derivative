# Derivative Calculator
Input a function and output the derivative of it. Only work with polynomial, so no power rule or quotient rule. 

This is my very first program on Github since I've just created the account a day earlier. I'm studying Calculus right now as a high 
school junior so derivative really is a pain in my butt. I hope I can make this one to help me calculate the derivative faster and easier.
